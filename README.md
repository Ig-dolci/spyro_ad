# spyro_ad
This Python package is a copy of the original spyro package (https://github.com/NDF-Poli-USP/spyro) 
that composes the implementation of wave propagation and Full Waveform Inversion (FWI).
Modifications were made to generate an automated adjoint-based gradient given by firedrake_adjoint.
